HP Z2 G5 SFF Hackintosh with opencore

I use this machine on a daily basis, its solid as a rock. 

Learn OpenCore, don't just copypasta EFI's, kexts, .plist files, pathces, when you find them on the wildweb. Open, read, put some brain's into it, learn something. You owe it to ALL creators, contributors before you.

Both fun and frustrating at times, just like kids. =)

USB Ports mapped and named in USBPorts.kext, check the .plist or just run Hackintool when in OS. There are 2 ports removed to keep below the magic limit, located at the back (2 black USB2.0) I wont bother doing a writeup for that here.
